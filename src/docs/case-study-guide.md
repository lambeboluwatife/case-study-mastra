## CASE STUDIES

### What Is a Case Study?

Case studies in business policy and strategy are used to simulate real business situations. A case is a written description of an enterprise that contains the history and ideology of the firm and its internal and external operations.

We can also refer to a case study as the acquisition of facts, opinions, and judgment where a problem exists and decisions are made to provide solutions to the existing problem.
